Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `relevance` for local development.

1. Clone the `relevance` repo on GitHub.::

    git clone git@github.com:jgeysen-work/relevance.git

2. Create a pipenv environment (assuming you have the `basics <https://github.com/anmut-consulting/pipenv-cookiecutter/blob/master/the_basics.md>`_ covered) ::

    cd relevance
    pipenv install --dev
    pipenv run pre-commit install

3. Activate your environment shell. ::

    pipenv shell

4. Create a branch for local development::

    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass all the tests by running::

    pipenv run pytest
    pipenv run pytest --cov --cov-fail-under=100
    pipenv run pipenv check

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.6+

Tips
----

You can check the command next to each of the **entry:** lines in `this file </.pre-commit-config.yaml>`_ to understand what each of the individual pre-commit hooks runs.
